# Welcome to the Depthcharge Boot Guide

> **Before you proceed with this guide, we strongly recommend using [MrChromebox UEFI/RW_L scripts](https://mrchromebox.tech/), as they are easier to install and result in fewer post-installation issues. RW_L can be installed on most devices without modifying firmware too.**

This guide is crafted in a timeless manner and therefore does not provide copy-paste commands. Instead, it assumes some basic Linux knowledge. Don't worry, you don't need to be a professional Linux user. It is entirely feasible to follow this guide without any prior knowledge, especially if you leverage the internet for help or utilize artificial intelligence.

> **Note:** The issues tab is exclusively for enhancing this guide. If you require help with following the guide, feel free to ask in the discord server.
