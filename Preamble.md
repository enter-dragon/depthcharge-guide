# Welcome to the Depthcharge boot guide.

## Before you follow this guide, please strongly consider using [MrChromeboxs' UEFI/RW_L scripts](https://mrchromebox.tech/) as those are easier to install and you will have less issues post-installation. RW_L can be installed on most devices without modifying firmware too.

<br/><br/>This guide is written in a timeless manner and therefore will not provide you with copy-paste commands, but will instead assume some basic linux knowledge. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN** that you have to be a professional Linux user, it is totally possible to do this guide without any prior knowledge, **if** you use the internet for help or use artificial intelligence.

The issues tab may **ONLY** be used for improving the guide. If you need help with **following the guide**, try asking in the discord server.
